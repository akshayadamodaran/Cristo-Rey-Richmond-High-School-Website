Goal was to make the website more navigable and visual so that different audiences can find and understand relevant information easily.

## Main Features and Improvements

* Segregation of content according to relevant audiences.
* Menu-driven pages for easy navigation.
* Design adhering to the concept of ‘less is more’ – use of infographics, timeline and process diagrams to make information easy to grasp by audiences of both languages – Spanish & English.
* Use of updated colors and logo based on the Identity Guide.
